      <p>Everyday, Brighton High School student Colin O'Connor walks to the school and he passes by Glenn Ellyn plaza. Since the pandemic started, he's noticed store closures in the area, particularly that of Dunkin' Donuts.</p>
      <p>"It was cheaper than Starbucks, so I liked it," O'Connor said, "Now, there's no more morning donuts."</p>
      <p>For businesses at the Glen Eylln plaza in Brighton, the COVID pandemic was a hard hit. Out of the 13 storefronts in 2020, only seven remain open in 2021.</p>
      <p>Three stores, Dunkin' Donuts, the Otter Lodge, and the Brighton Martial Arts studio, demonstrate the spectrum of hope and challenge for businesses in Glenn Eylln plaza.</p>

        <strong>The Prodigal Donut Shop </strong>
        <p> Brighton Donuts served its signature tasty treats including the Zebra donut (chocolate with vanilla frosting), for over a decade.</p>
        <p> In 2009, the shop closed and the space was bought by Dunkin' Donuts which itself was then shut down in 2020
          due to the pandemic. </p>

        <p>Ron Zour, a one time employee at Malek's Bakery, is eyeing the space next door for his own business venture.</p>
        <p>"Malek's is a kohser bakery and Brighton Donuts used to be kosher. Dunkin' kind of committed to going kosher in the beginning, but then they started getting their baked goods shipped from Buffalo, they didn't even bake them there!" Zour
          said, "The kosher thing is still important to a lot of people in Brighton. I think it would fufill a need."</p>
        <p> &nbsp;</p>
        <strong>Under New Management</strong>
        <p>Right next door, the Sheffield bar and grill actually opened during the pandemic. According to the owners, it actually made things easier to prepare for COVID health standards. </p>
        <p>"Because we were already in there, it was actually pretty simple to readjust to the new conditions," Casey Walpert, co-owner of the Sheffield said. </p>

        <p>Walpart and Joe McBane also own the Tap and Mallet pub located in the South Wedge neighborhood. When learning that the Otter Lodge space in Glenn Eylln plaza was avaliable, they decided to expand their ventures.</p>
        <p>"[The Otter Lodge] has a nice central location to Brighton and had a bit of a following. We're optimistic about our chances here," Walpert said.</p>
        <p> &nbsp;</p>
        <strong>The Hopeful but Empty </strong>
        <p>The Brighton Martial Arts Studio had plans to close prior to the COVID pandemic in 2020 due to dropping enrollment.</p>
        <p>Martial arts studios were no exceptions to the COVID restrictions shutting down non-essential businesses. The Brighton Martial Arts Studio in the Glenn Eylln plaza already had plans to leave the space in 2020, the new laws simply sped that
          process along.</p>

        <p>Other martial arts studios have found creative adaptations. For example, Master Kim's Tae Kwan Do now offers lessons on Zoom. Master Sung Kim, the operator of the three locations, himself currently teaches from his basement.</p>
        <p>For now, however, the space at 1780 Monroe Avenue remains empty.</p>
